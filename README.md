Becoming a **master-level iOS developer** depends on your **background, experience, and learning intensity**. Since you already have **2+ years Flutter experience, backend knowledge, and strong DSA skills**, your timeline will be faster than a complete beginner.

Here’s a realistic breakdown:

---

## 1️⃣ **Beginner → Competent iOS Developer**

**Goal:** Able to build functional iOS apps independently and publish to App Store

| Duration   | Focus                                                                | Notes                                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–2 months | **Swift basics** (syntax, OOP, optionals, closures, structs/classes) | Fast for you because you know Dart/Flutter; concepts are transferable  |
| 1–2 months | **SwiftUI + UIKit basics**                                           | Build 2–3 simple apps: todo app, weather app, or simple UI clone       |
| 1 month    | **Networking + JSON parsing**                                        | Connect apps to REST APIs; you can leverage your Spring Boot knowledge |
| 1 month    | **Data persistence**                                                 | CoreData, UserDefaults, or local database (SQLite)                     |

**Total:** ~4–6 months to be **competent**

## 2️⃣ **Competent → Advanced iOS Developer**

**Goal:** Can handle production apps, complex UI, concurrency, and debugging

| Duration   | Focus                                         | Notes                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1–2 months | **Swift Concurrency / Async-Await + Combine** | Modern iOS apps heavily use this        |
| 1 month    | **App architecture patterns**                 | MVC, MVVM, Clean Architecture           |
| 1 month    | **Unit testing + UI testing**                 | XCTest, TDD principles                  |
| 1 month    | **Advanced UIKit / SwiftUI**                  | Animations, custom components, gestures |

**Total:** ~4–5 months to become **advanced**

## 3️⃣ **Advanced → Master iOS Developer**

**Goal:** Recognized as expert; can design complex apps, mentor, contribute to open source

| Duration   | Focus                                              | Notes                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2–3 months | **Core frameworks mastery**                        | Core Animation, Core Data, Core ML, ARKit                  |
| 2 months   | **Performance optimization + debugging**           | Instruments, memory management, threading                  |
| 2 months   | **Open source contribution / App Store portfolio** | Real apps, large projects, Swift packages                  |
| 1 month    | **Architect large apps + best practices**          | Design patterns, modular apps, CI/CD, deployment pipelines |

**Total:** ~6–8 months to reach **mastery level** after becoming advanced
